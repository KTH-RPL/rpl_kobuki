KTH-RPL kobuki robot
---

Some reference:

- Manual book for turtlebot2 kobuki: https://learn.turtlebot.com/2015/02/01/1/  [But most of them are redundant]
- Official repo: [https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki.git](https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki.git)

Why we need this? 

1. kobuki is produced at 2015 which is really far away, this repo will only provide the thing you can run the kobuki robot [maunal control using keyboard or remote control].
2. This is for us to collected our own dataset **mainly indoor**, or tested our algorithm in a **real robot**. 

Test System: Ubuntu 20.04 noetic

Test Day: 2023/03/09 17:53

Sensor setup:

- Velodyne VLP-16
- Livox Avia

Will add more... like camera (rgb/depth).



Picture of it:

TODO (since Patric and I are rebuilding this power setting)

## Dependencies & Build

reference: https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki/issues/427, https://github.com/yujinrobot/kobuki/issues/382

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt-get install liborocos-kdl-dev libusb-dev libftdi-dev ros-noetic-joy ros-noetic-ecl-core ros-noetic-ecl-console ros-noetic-ecl-mobile-robot -y
```

```bash
git clone TODO_public_link # this repo
```



1. `kobuki.cpp` for the serial read thing.
2. `subscriber_callbacks.cpp` topic will send to kobuki


## Run

1. you need change the config file, `base.yaml`, the most import thing is:

   ```bash
   device_port: /dev/ttyUSB0
   ```

2. Open the minimal one:

   ```bash
   roslaunch kobuki_node minimal.launch
   ```

3. AND THEN run keyboard control, so we can start the kobuki!

   ```bash
   roslaunch kobuki_keyop keyop.launch
   ```

   if everything success, we will see this, and then press keyboard `â†‘` button:

   ```bash
   Forward/back arrows : linear velocity incr/decr.
   Right/left arrows : angular velocity incr/decr.
   Spacebar : reset linear/angular velocities.
   d : disable motors.
   e : enable motors.
   q : quit.
   ```
